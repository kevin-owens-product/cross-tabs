# Postman

## If you want to run the postman crosstab calls:
With the project's postman file (ask the devs of pro-next for it) you can test Crosstab calls.
Let's see how to set it up:
1) Import the collection into your postman.
2) Go to GWI web and in Network get the bearer token of any call.
3) Copy it and go to the config folder of the GWI folder.
4) Paste your token.

## If you want to add important calls don't forget to:
1) Set the Authorization to ‘Inherit auth from parents’.
2) Send the Json to the other Devs in the project.
