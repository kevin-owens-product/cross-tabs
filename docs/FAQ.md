## How does the sprint planning work?

We work in two-weeks sprints with tickets estimated by [Story Points](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation#:~:text=Story%20points%20are%20units%20of,work%2C%20and%20risk%20or%20uncertainty.).

Here’s a map of SP → Man days:

- 1 SP → Super easy task. 0.5 days
- 2 SP → Easy task. 1 day
- 3 SP → Regular task. 2 days
- 5 SP → Difficult task. 3-4 days
- 8 SP → Complicated task. 5-7 days
- 13 SP → Enormous amount of work, split this task! 10+ days (2 weeks)

> [!WARNING]  
> Tasks with more than 13 SP should not be created!
