# Icons Overview

The file `Overview.elm` contains all icons that can be used in `pro-next` with Elm by using `Icons` library. The overview can be generated by `elm-make`.

```
elm make Overview.elm --output icons-overview.html
```

When you are adding or removing icons, please update the `Overview.elm` model. You are encouraged to generate the overview file after tweaking icons as it is a good visual check that the icon was added correctly with right viewport settings etc..
